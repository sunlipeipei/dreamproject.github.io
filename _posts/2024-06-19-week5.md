title: Week 5 Project Methodology
---

In the fifth week, there is a shift on my research direction. Instead of building interactive persona, I was directed to propose methods for stereotype and biases detection, monitoring and correction in the interactive persona system. Please see revised project overview at the end of the slides for reference. Meanwhile, I watched the Building Persona coordiantion meeting this monday and got a better understanding on what NLP and UI team are working on. Therefore I have a better idea on how I can propose a framework for interactive persona system evaluation from stereotype and biases perspective.
