---

During the first week of the project, I conducted a literature review forcusing on Persona Tool in HCI (Knowledge graph), Approaches for Designing persona, and Interactive Persona. I presented findings to my advisor and walked through challenges and considerations regarding persona design and interactive persona. My advisor also introduced me to another team that is working on building LLMs interactive persona from the backends.
