title: Week 4 Project Methodology & Study Procedure
---

In the fourth week, I focused on literature review to develop a system for evaluating interactive personas and detecting stereotypes. I explored the CoMPosT framework, the LLM Stereotype Index, and complementary approaches involving community engagement. Human evaluation methods by UX researchers and subject matter experts were also reviewed to assess persona quality and biases, leading to strategies for data correction and prompt design. The evaluation aims to improve the accuracy and inclusiveness of interactive personas.
