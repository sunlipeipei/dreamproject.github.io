title: Week 2 Literature Review
---

During the second week of the project, I conducted a literature review focusing on LLMs and the challenges related to stereotypes and biases, as well as human-centered design (HCD) phases and the use of persona tools in those phases. I presented my findings to my advisor and walked through the challenges and considerations regarding the use of LLMs and personas in human-centered design phases. For next week, I will start drafting project proposal, introduction, and literature review sections.
This week, I also had the opportunity to meet some of the students from the Dream research projects, as well as my mentor, Tom William, from the Colorado School of Mines. Tom shared with me his academic path and provided me with a broad understanding of his research area, as well as information about PhD programs.
