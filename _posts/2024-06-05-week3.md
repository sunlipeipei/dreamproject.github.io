title: Week 3 Project Overview & Methodology
---

During the third week of the project, I drafted a project overview that includes the research problem, motivation, research gap, research questions, and the purpose of the project/study. This overview has been reviewed with my advisor. Meanwhile, I have also drafted the introduction and literature review on Overleaf, based on previous literature review studies. Additionally, I explored the methodology and methods used by other researchers to evaluate personas and detect bias and stereotypes. See the slides below for additional information.
