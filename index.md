## About My Project

This research project will focus on the application of large language models (LLMs) to building interactive Persona.
The main goal is to investigate the hypothesis whether (and under which circumstances) LLMs can be applied to creation of Persona and how to facilitate interactivity while bypassing LLM-associated challenges such as bias and stereotyping. A thorough literature review will be conducted, including an analysis of research papers and applications. The student will architect, design and implement an LLM-based persona that can support designers in exploratory-stages of human-centered design. Additionally, a pilot evaluation study will be conducted.
