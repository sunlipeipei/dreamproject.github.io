## About Me

Hello! I'm Lipeipei Sun, a current master's student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, embarking on an exciting journey that bridges the creative world of architecture with the innovative realm of technology.

My story begins at the University of Washington, where I received my Bachelor of Arts in Architecture and Master of Architecture degrees. During my time there, I delved into the intricate art of architecture and discovered the power of design in shaping our environments and impacting lives. During my study, I received the Thesis Award for my thesis "Re-Envisioning Rural Urban Development in Dali, China".

As technology continued to revolutionize every aspect of our lives, I realized the great potential of computer science in enhancing and transforming the field of design. This realization led to my transition into tech. I saw an opportunity to blend my design expertise with cutting-edge technology to push the boundaries of creativity and design.

At Northeastern University, through the Align Master's Program, I am diving into the depths of computer science. Here, I am not just learning to code; I am exploring how to innovate, transform abstract ideas into tangible solutions, and apply a user-centered approach to technology. I plan to graduate in December 2025.

## About My Project

This research project will focus on the application of large language models (LLMs) to building interactive Persona.
The main goal is to investigate the hypothesis whether (and under which circumstances) LLMs can be applied to creation of Persona and how to facilitate interactivity while bypassing LLM-associated challenges such as bias and stereotyping. A thorough literature review will be conducted, including an analysis of research papers and applications. The student will architect, design and implement an LLM-based persona that can support designers in exploratory-stages of human-centered design. Additionally, a pilot evaluation study will be conducted.
